3. Running Simulations
There are two types of simulations supported: KiNCoL and Simulation UI. 
Depending on the type of simulation required, the developer may choose one or 
the either. Below are instructions for running KiNCoL:

1. Open terminal/cmd and navigate to the binary distribution folder. 
2. Within command prompt, type the following:

java KimonoNet mode-cl [number-of-peers map-width map-height hostility-factor 
peer-speed number-of-packets [beacon-timeout]]

Parameter Discriptions:

number-of-peers   (integer) : The number of peers to participate in the simulation.
map-width         (integer) : Map width in meters.
map-height        (integer) : Map height in meteres.
hostility-factor  (float)   : Value in the range of [0, 1] that indicates the 
                              probability of node failure. 
peer-speed        (float)   : Average speed of a node in the simulation.
number-of-packets (integer) : Number of packets to send from a random source to a 
                              stationary destination.
beacon-timeout    (integer) : Value in milliseconds that indicates the frequency 
                              of becaon packets. 


3.After running the simulation, results will be displayed on the console.

4. To turn off 2-hop routing to simulate GPSR, instead of mode-cl, type
mode-cl-gpsr.
