 *    out its own beacon.
 * 2. <b>max-beacon-peers</b>: Maximum number of peers to be included in beacon 
 *    packets.
 * 3. <b>node-failure-rate</b>: With some frequency specified by this value, 
 *    nodes will completely shutdown. This allows simulation of hostile 
 *    environment.
 * 4. <b>packet-loss-rate</b>: Packets will be discarded on the receiving end at
 *    some frequency according to this value. For example 0.1 will indicate 10%

 * 5. <b>max-transmission-range</b>: Packets above received further away than 
 *    this distance specified in meters will be discarded.
 * 6. <b>average-gps-accuracy</b>: Indicates the average value of some
